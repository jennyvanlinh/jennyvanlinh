i'm a final year university student studying business information systems, with an interest in data visualization. i'm interested in that field because i like to create visualizations using tableau and explore my creativity.

aside from that, my other hobbies include: 
- creating illustrations on canva
- browsing social media
- reading manga and webtoons
- watching movies
